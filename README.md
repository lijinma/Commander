Commander
=========

The solution for php command-line interfaces, inspired by [commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) in Node.js.

Actually some funtions in Commander is refer to [commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js), so really thank TJ.



## Installation

    $ composer require "lijinma/commander"
    
## Option parsing

Options with commander are defined with the `option()` method, also serving as documentation for the options. The example below parses args and options from `$argv`.

```php

<?php

use Lijinma\Commander;

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$cmd = new Commander();

$cmd
    ->version('0.0.1')
    ->option('-p, --peppers', 'Add peppers')
    ->option('-P, --pineapple', 'Add pineapple')
    ->option('-b, --bbq', 'Add bbq sauce')
    ->option('-c, --cheese [type]', 'Add the specified type of cheese')
    ->parse($argv);


echo 'you ordered a pizza with:' . PHP_EOL;
if (isset($cmd->peppers)) {
    echo '  - peppers' . PHP_EOL;
}
if (isset($cmd->pineapple)) {
    echo '  - pineapple' . PHP_EOL;
}
if (isset($cmd->bbq)) {
    echo '  - bbq' . PHP_EOL;
}

if (isset($cmd->cheese)) {
    echo "  - $cmd->cheese cheese" . PHP_EOL;
}

```

Short flags may be passed as a single arg, for example -abc is equivalent to -a -b -c.

## Sub commands

```php
<?php

use Lijinma\Commander;

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$cmd = new Commander();

$cmd
    ->version('0.0.1')
    ->command('rmdir <dir> [otherDirs...]', 'Remove the directory')
    ->action(
        function ($dir, $otherDirs) {
            echo 'You will remove the following directory: ' . $dir . PHP_EOL;
            if ($otherDirs) {
                echo 'And other directories: ' . implode(', ', $otherDirs) . PHP_EOL;
            }
        }
    );

$cmd->command('rm <file>', 'Remove a file')
    ->action(
        function ($file) {
            echo 'You will remove the following file: ' . $file . PHP_EOL;
        }
    );

$cmd->parse($argv);
```

Every command has one action.

##Automated --help

I really don't like the help generated by Symfony/Console, it's complicated and heavy.

```
  Usage: test.php [options]

  Commands:

    rmdir <dir> [otherDirs...]    Remove the directory
    rm <file>                     Remove a file

  Options:

    -h, --help  Output usage information
```

## Test Commander

I use [PHPSpec](http://www.phpspec.net) to do unit test. PHPSpec is an awesome test framework.

```
    $ composer install
    $ phpspec run
```
